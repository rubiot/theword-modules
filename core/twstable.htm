<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- english.lng changed</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- fixed shortcuts not working from floating views (e.g. CTRL+N from floating book view)</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: if the option to 'Hide Bible modules that do not contain the chapter currently visible' was set for the Compare view, then these modules were removed from the list of selected modules once the dialog to 'Select Bible text to compare' was displayed again</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: if the 'Disable temporarily clipboard monitoring for content copied...' option was checked in the Preferences-&gt;Clipboard monitoring tab, then the first time the Preferences dialog was displayed, a message was asking the user if he wants to disable Clipboard monitoring</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: Preferences-&gt;Bible texts: multi-selection allowed for moving up/down, select/unselect all</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: &lt;PF&gt; tag for first line indentation</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: added a 'Select Bible to search' link in Bible Search view -&gt; Advanced tab: this just pops up the proper menu. Also some changed to the 'Detailed' tab: the input box will stay on top (no scrolling)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: new version of renderer/editor</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: when clicking with the mouse in search input box (Bible &amp; Book search views), the text is selected.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: pasting text to search input boxes causes incorrect painting (left-overs). Also could not fully scroll to the beginning of the text (see bug: http://forum.theword.gr/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2320&amp;p=13256#p13256)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: Selecting Bibles for searching and compare view: the 'Show descriptions' option at the bottom, and the 'Use also for vertical/horizontal layout' (case of Compare) were not saved.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: the 'Define custom ranges' combo box in Bible search view (Detailed tab), could dissapear if shrinking the view too much; also, the search input box would disappear if making the view too small in height.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: bug in code that reads Bible text in non-encrypted NT or OT only modules could cause the Bible view to not display at all</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: when copying content from a popup that contains a verse-ref and the CM appears, the popup ended-up empty and activated.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [fix]: displaying the 'Select Bibles' for Compare view when in normal Bible view and then closing it, would not make the view switch to the compare view some times.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: Copy Verses dialog: added new placeholders for starting book/chapter/verse for the header field.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">- [new]: Added support for forward/backward mouse buttons. Changed Bible and Book view history shortctus from CTRL+Arrows to the standard ALT+Arrows (in Bible view, the CTRL+Arrows now moves to previous/next book)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts8">1117 - [fix]: When links were using defined bookmarks to limit the text in the popup to a part of the target topic, the bookmarks were not recognized if they belonged to a non-text item (e.g. tab, table, picture, etc)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">1118 - [fix]: changed 'chapter headings' to the more correct 'passage headings' (english.lng file)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">1118 - [fix]: user highlighting was offset in cases where a space (or more) followed a Cx tag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts6">NOTES: This is a more general fix since with more spaces before, after or between Cx and Px tags would cause the same effect.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">1118 - [fix]: Searching with 'Whole words' or 'Phrase search' would fail in case of a word that was just after a Cx tag (e.g. "God&lt;CI&gt;created"). Searching for "created" with 'Whole words on', or for "God created" would fail.</span></p>

So, stripping the "God&lt;CI&gt;created" phrase will result in "God created" (before the fix, it would result in "Godcreated")</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [fix]: popup window appears above with the HWND_TOPMOST flag now, this means that it will work properly if the main window is set to be a topmost window by a 3rd party app</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1353</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [fix]: right-click menu in Bible view could fail to properly detect the word under cursor if the word was the last one in a line in r2l modules.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [...] continuing on 1346: commentary links: proper prioritization of comment selection from hybrid modules that contains comments for multiple spans (e.g. NIC/Romans): comments for smaller passages (ideally single verses) should have priority</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1357</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [new]:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - the index for subjects (topics_wordindex table) is being rebuild for all book modules on startup: the match of subjects has changed a bit: the change only affects languages that use diacritics (Greeks, Hebrew, etc): when matching a word, a match with diacritics is first attempted and if it fails then a match without diacritics is attempted.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - In order to avoid rebuilding the topics_wordindex table (for future updates that is), a new config option is now supported in the config table: search.topics.no.autobuild. If this is set to '1', then the topics_wordindex table is never being rebuild automatically (and the corresponding action from the Module Properties dialog is disallowed). The TDNTa official module is currently the only official module that has a custom topics_wordindex table that should not be rebuilt automatically: special provision has been included for this module to avoid corruption. The book module spec document has also been updated.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1360</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [...]: b1359 popup fix: footnotes were using the Book view background and Bible view colors which was wrong: now footnotes popups use Bible view background &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1463</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [change]: regular expression Bible searches are now greedy by default. To switch back to old non-greedy behavior, add in the [general] section of the config.ini bible.search.regex.ungreedy=1</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1466</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [fix]: Cross-reference statistics dialog would display the total of the NT in the OT line, if there was no OT xref but only NT xrefs</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [fix]: Copy verses dialog: when the X is clicked (step 1), the preview is cleared.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1469</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [fix]: When detecting verse references in a contextual context in a commentary (e.g. book and/or chapter are assumed by the current commentary book and/or chapter, this happens with CTRL+SHIFT pressed and context-menu with "Detect all verse references in viewer" option), and the commentary text is non-ansii (e.g. Greek, Chinese), then the offsets of the detected verse references were wrong, e.g. the actual hyperlinks were further to the right of the actual verse numbers (bug report: http://forum.theword.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=6923&amp;p=36016#p36016)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1470</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [chnage]: Bible view context-menu now appears on mouse-release (instead of mouse-press) and is consistent with book-view behavior.

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Make sure the file url does not contains a 'dynamic' part (e.g. parameters with a ?)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; 1475</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class="rvts6">&nbsp; &nbsp; - [new]: added case.sensitive.word.index option in config table of dictionary/book modules: if set to 1, then lookups (and the wordindex) are case sensitive.

They are not smooth, unless they are PNG transparent in which case they are still not smooth when scaled down.
