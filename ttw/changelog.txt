0.3.4-
	-Find needed a GlobalBoolean reset, also updated counter code for Regex Replace.
0.3.5-
	-Replace, Replace All, All Pairs All Replace should be much faster. Thanks Rubio, I got to thinking and sped up the regex by basically doing the original regex twice instead of building my own much faster. I still want to see. I may be able to speed it up more.
0.3.6-
	-Added zero width space after </ref>, </link>, </tlink> to prevent it from jumping to a following hyperlink possibly and should fix a bookmark from jumping to next line, and it gives it something to hang on if it is back to back bookmarks.

	-a fix a few bugs related to above
0.3.9-
	-Added regex options, help, working on.
	-^ and $ works in Multiline - should also work with formatting
	-\n and \r works in Singline - still testing with format seems to work differently than it should not sure why.
	-Note CR, LF, CRLF is the setting for the PCRE engine - once we get a good setting these will be hidden probably.
	-Note None, #13CR, #13CR#10LF is for TRichViewEdit settig - once we get a good setting these will be hidden probably.
0.4.0-
       -Important note SingleLine is DotAll as indicated in the Hint so image . now is extremely greedy it can cover LF/#10, CR#13 so less greedy regexes can be helpful like .*? etc. 	
	-Added regopts to pairs = sorry please readd pairs the original pairs may cause an error sorry.
	-Check out the Help on Regex Options for PCRE 6.7 --- advanced help avaible in side the Help Folder in the sub folder "PCRE-6.7 Help"
0.4.2-
	Two search logics: Search then Format Check (Find, Replace, Replace All) OR Format Check then Search (Find done, Replace and Replace all are not done yet).
	-A new search logic is being worked on which is "Test format than Search" (To use uncheck Search then chk fmt) - note it only works in Find at this point. Replace and Replace All to come. 
	-The previous search logic "Search than Test Format" make sure "Search then chk fmt" is checked. (Note an improvement in this area has happened as well if you do .+ with bold. It should select only the first occurence of bold.
0.4.3-
	-Worked on fixing Find jumping to next search area when clicked
	-LM is Paragraph markers it disappeared off the popup not sure why I think the file didn't update on my other pc right or something. However, we may need to do somethinglike this in the long run because with that I am actually updating some of the TRichView files which I could forget in the future. So I need to learn how to add it to the popup a different way if I can.
	-Test Format is something that works with "Format then Search" Logic however it is a work in progress. I am not sure I will be able to solve this riddle of the combination of Format and Regex mixed it seems they are soo separate perhaps another day. It sure would be nice.
0.4.3b-
	-Replace and Replace All added.
	-Note normal search does not work with this search logic except on Find maybe.
	-Search selection may or may not work I have not tested it	
	-Note I am finding like a space may only get its formatting adjusted on the first replace instance. (I am not sure if it is a single character issue or not this will be interesting to chase down this bug.) 
	-Some like .+$ is not correct but many things may be helpful with this methodology. Not perfect but closer to LibreOffice. I will continue to bring other things up to speed. We will see I may remove the previous logic it is still available for now.
0.4.4-	
	-Load <:> bug fixed no longer resizes.
	-Bugs worked on in new format/search for Find, Replace, Replace All. (I recommend testing on a Find before using Replace or Replace All) (Still some more and they are hard to trace down. Hmms I'll have to come back to this another time.)
	-Seems to work best on at least one format option chosen if not, Replace All seems to be having trouble.
	-Note Normal Search doesn't work much with new logic as of yet.
0.4.5-
	-BCV now works with space at front or end of reference text and letter next to reference
0.4.6-
	-Improvements in Format then Regex logic -- Find should work better, Replace (is odd if the format and regex falls on the first character in a match. Needs more testing), Replace All seems to work better.
	-An excellent way to test is to save then include a highlight in Replace format then you know what was changed then you can revert to save and do the same without the highlight. 
	-Format then Regex should work without find formatting enabled. 
	-I removed the Depressed look from Font Color and Text Background Color in Replace because if it is on it is being replaced unlike bold which may be "You want a word Bolded" or you want "Bold removed" or you want it unaffected.
0.4.7-
	-Added, Narrow-width, Space, Nothing for Link/Reference in Build
	-Added a TreeView that shows the items of TRichView in a browsable way very informative for indepth data. (May be an advanced item in the future like developer mode or something.) It will help me track down bugs I think.
	Thanks Sergey! and another guy Jonjon on the forum. There are some things here and there. Note if you hold down Ctrl while mousing over the TreeView after update it will scroll the RichView to that area. The bug is that it should highlight the correct node when you select an item in RichView but it doesn't hmms
0.4.8-
	-A bit of internal cleaning
	-There is a bug with paragraph style being used instead of font style when InsertText is made at the start of a Paragraph.

	-Added config.ini in here you tell it what language to search for in <bcv> use the name of the file found in lng
	-If || is found then Old method is used otherwise New method
	-Note new method is not Pre-checkable - so if it is flagged think Old - method.
	-<bc> and <chp> are available once per topic (Any more and they won't do anything), I recommend that they go inside the topic some place but not in the topic <:> or <c>
0.5.2-
	-Fixed || was broken
	-Changed name from <bc> to <bk>
	-Also <bcv> works in this case a note from Costas "Notice that this method will only parse a single book name (the first one)."

	-Button in File>Reload Config if you need to refresh the data of the bcv language.
0.5.7-
	- the hypen "-" in the book list is now swapped out automatically internally with $ - to speed it up slightly on building this list

	-Not much changed with hyphen - and $ other than extensive testing. To trying to make Find get - which it does not appear to recognize in Lazarus.
	-Roman Check box added in BCV detect which also affects <bcv>

0.5.9-
	-Last VRef in Acts 14:2, 5; 1 Tim 3:5 can now be tested so 1 does not become part of Acts 14:2 note it may have a double hyperlink so this may need testing.
	-Some speed ups were implemented such as testing vrefs between enters. (This may or may not make it faster).	
	-A warning is given if you select from End to Start, it needs to be Start to End;

	b- update to the BCV Reference detection code (now it copies the selection to another area works on it and pastes it back. Which may help with not dealing with all the text however formatting after it is pasted back is slow.)

	-d The sections are as follows search tab replace tab [regexoptions]	{repeat_until_no_match}

	-9 Added more roIgnoreCase to different Regex in Detect Ref

D1.0.0a-
	-a Massive changes - TotheWord is now built in Delphi 11 so unicode and other things are much easier to do now. However, there will need to be much much testing. Also Find/Replace pairs need loaded and verified and then resaved since the Regex options have changed.
	-a Special open needs fixed Reference detection is wrong.
	-a Reference Detection in general is broken and will cause the program to freeze. I need to fix it.
	-a If you could let me know of any other bugs you come across. Thank you.
	-b Fixed, Include Topic in context, Draft Build, Show export, Pre-Export Check (NEEDS UPDATED)
	-b Went through and fixed standard formatting, however, if there is an error perhaps it needs to be GRichViewEdit or RichViewEdit in the RVGetTextLength and in RVGetTextRange
	-b Font Replacement Tool in Detect. It is very fast. You can click in the RichViewEdit and it will update the first font box then input in the Replace and lastly click Replace Font.
	-c RTF format works in Module export. However, I am still working on RVF. 
	-c Note docking has not been worked on yet. Still working on detect references

	-g TotheWord version added to config when module is built.
	-g Detect Verse References hopefully fixed! Needs much testing.
	-g Revelation, Romans, Psalm, Exodus, not Detecting references why?????? It is not matched in ParseBookNameW -- I think it was a sorting problem before the - is before like -relation so Romans is ignored it needs to be at the bottom of the list!!!IT was fixed by changing - to @ and WDASH from '-' to '@'

	-d The Find setting buttons now have a grayed out state instead of a box

	-e/f Format then Regex added (Find, Replace, Replace All) need tested (To turn this mode on make sure "Check Regex then Format" Is unchecked (TESTING is needed, but please specify all the settings even save them to a Find/Replace Pair and send me this if you find a bug)
	-g Find (Format then Regex) working better, as is Replace when using \p{Greek}+ but Replace All missing some (Not sure why???)

	-g Regex then Format is working pretty good overall
	-g some Hints changed, not sure when/if I can get to button changes it is more complicated. I would need to build new button images.

	-t updated Mark Non-Links (works better with cells now)
	-u Updated Detect Reference removed a +1 it was affecting verses 1, 2, 3, 4 that is detection when no book or chapter is found. It was only marking the first number. Right reference wrong numbers.
	-v Works better with tables on Find/replace but but tables that don’t have rows (if they have rows welll it doesn’t work yet - sorry!)
	-v Updated Find/Replace/Replace All to give better progress indicators.
	-v When the cursor is flashing in Find/Replace/Replace All check the progress bar there is a reason. It may be going through the items looking for the appropriate formatting. (ESC to cancel)
	-w updated strongs to strong in config. 
	-x Press ESC to cancel added to Formatting Hebrew, Greek, Strongs, etc. see progress bar
	-x Select section of Formatting Hebrew, Greek, Strongs, etc possible now. See check box in formatting area.

	-5 Updated GbutEsc to the False where it needs to be “hopefully” if after pressing ESC something finishes surprisingly fast this may be why (A GbutEsc:=False may need added)
	-- Caret was getting stuck due to not letting the Regex set FoundBool to True (It never got turned back off - oooops)
	-6 Added copy Reference links to clipboard (note I attempted to make it only get new links in a selection but it will get most of the links, I could have it do all always)

	-4 Added Regex Count in Find of Find/Replace it is the button 123 also next to it is Fn which is for footnote count. (Note this should work inside of tables either way.)
	-5 Added Unlick in Detect Reference
	-- Added goto next checkbox under replace (default on)
	-- Updated implicit/regular detection with removal of . at the end of each divided string of references (hopefully will work and not cause more bugs) - it was causing misalignment
	-- Updated Case detection in Detect Reference so not II Timothy 2:1 should work.
	-- Added a new type of footnote import in Special Open unique_footnote (this is intended to keep each footnote unique if they are not already.) However, you must put in something in each file to help make it unique.

D1.3
	-0 Interface additionas many
	--Editor Mode 
	--- switch between Book, Bible, Regex Editor
	--Book Editor (much the same)
	--Each Editor mode has its own Content (All appear in the Main RichViewEdit area)
	---Open Updated to a new area for Book Editor

	--Bible Editor
	--Each Editor mode has its own Content (All appear in the Main RichViewEdit area)
	---Not really implemented (however there is now a Bible Build tab with config info that is beginning to come along)
	---Open Updated to include Bible (It will be controlled primarily by a .ttwregex file same format as the Book ttwregex file.
	---Please let me know if I am missing anything visually in the Config of Bible Build.
	---Apocrypha in Bible Build > Build will be interesting to implement technically the RVF or RTF file of it will need to be loaded into the Book Editor side so that it will all mesh together correctly. In case of needing to link between footnotes and apocrypha. 
	--Bibles will really be built by the ttwregex file. Which implements the formatting. It is a regex pair file. Much like theWord Bible Verse.rule but more...
	--Regex Editor
	--Each Editor mode has its own Content (All appear in the Main RichViewEdit area)
	---Open > Regex Editor
	----Format this is if you would like it to format the comment section for you automatically (Slower load but helps visually either way is fine)
	----Open works you can load a ttwregex file or a XHTMLRegex.txt file from previous
	----I am not sure I like where the Regex Save As button is. I may add this to the Save As area under File we will see though it is special since it is a UTF-8 ttwregex file. (Thoughts??)
	--Technically ttwregex files can be edited but are not yet supported in Book Special Open or in Bible yet.
	--Find/Replace small update
	----MultiLine and SingleLine are no longer grouped together since you can use them separately. (This should not affect the find/replace pairs I tried to make it compatible with old pair files.
	--Across Book, Bible, and Regex Editor you will find that Find/Replace is enabled since this will be beneficial in any mode.
	---Bible will not really need a color edit tab since the tags are what control elements. (I really hope we can have theWord Bible Viewer code connected here but for now it will just be the code viewer mode.)
	--Help Files many many updates
	----Regex Options is now the correct version
	----Book, Bible Editors are todo they are basically a template holder
	----Special Open Help removed the Regex pairs portion now in its own file
	----Bible Module specification file added.
	----Regex Editor Help has some info in it.
	----User additions to help files are simple. Just open the .rvf or .rtf file.
	------For the Book, Bible, Regex helps it is simple to link like in the files already. It is just a bookmark. You can hyperlink to a bookmark by putting # first than the bookmark name. (I could use some help with building the help files)
	--Config file has some updates (more to come)
	--map folder
	----new has some map sample files
	--Example folder
	----small examples to be here for learning purposes
	--templates will probable have like a sample ttwregex (we will see)
	--1 Added No break space and other space types in Reference detection, plus other types of hypens, and a bit more
	--2 Changed Replace TEdit in Find/Replace to TMemo so it can have multiplelines (TEdit was kept just incase but renamed for now)
	--3 Mutiple additions in RegexEditor
	--4 \r and \n supported in RegexEditorRules, and in Find/Replace - Replace side. 
	--5 Some Save/Save As settings updated. (Now Book and Bible won't accidentally overwrite eachother in Save)
	---Should display the file name in the Caption area. Also somewhat in the Status bar area for Regex, but Book and BIble not so much in Status area I think for Save As
	---Bible Editor Config files should now work.
	---Map files, and Processing to go
	--6 Updated Regex Rules to include [file=all], [file=specific] note must include name and ending, or if you don't put any [file= in the file it is treated like an all
	---Bible tags are <bk_bi:\d+>,  <bk_bname:Genesis>, <chp_bi:\d+>, <ver_bi:\d+> the <bk_bname:name> are defined in the Bible Editor Help, there are located fullname or abbreviations. (Regex rules can be used to map to these names)
	---The Bible tags are used in build step to put the book, chapter, verse in the right place so Map files will work. However it is important to make sure <ver_bi:\d+> is at the start of each line for the map files to work right.
	---There is a warning on file line amount on building
	---About file, and Map file need done yet for Bibles. 
	--7 About File for Bibles done (only Map file left)
	---ERROR on Bible file now counted and informs user (only so far for <bk_bname...
	---RegexRules Matches are now counted and saved to file if checked in Open > Book Editor > 5.... They are saved to a file much like the Edited sample file except its ays -Matches.txt
	---The Matches file looks I dentical to the TTWRegex rules file except it says MATCHES=#>>>> before the lines 0 if no matches or howmany matches there are.
	--8 Unicode now works for Verse Detection inside of the Special Open for xhtml, html, and htm Note requires DIUtils
	---Map file added to working with Bibles.
	---Apocrypha support yet to go. but in time
	---Pre-export check tells you a bit more now.
	--9 Pre-export updated a bit (still not as good as build)
	
D1.4
	--0
	---Regex Rules have been spead up. They are now loaded once instead of per each Edited File. Also if SingleLine is NOT checked then the Edited File is done a line at a time instead of the whole file as a single line.
	---Find/Detect Pairs added to Detect Tab
	----To add pairs select some text, and then Right Click in the Find/Detect Pairs area. You can then Add, Delete a Pair or Run All Pairs
	---Reference Tab moved to its own. (I may need to work on docking again.)
	---Regex Rule Engine should be fixed now, Matches, and Files should work.
	--1
	---Find/Detect Pairs updated, no more template, now loads correct file instead of Find/Replace Pair, also shows File if load, has various warnings now. For example if no pairs but , Run All Pairs it will warn you.	
	---Iinterface updtates like Build Bible, Build Book
	---Fixed V11Map I had set it only to OT
	--2
	---Check Regex Rules now checks for basic formatting in the Regex Rules (It does not check regex though)
	--3
	---Error List window now for Find/Detect pairs instead of just a single popup (This ErrorList window may be helpful in other areas at some point)
	---F6 Is now for Add Find/Detect Pair
	---Put F3, F4, F5, F6 on their respective buttons - more visual
	--4
	---Infinite looping message and skips if infinite loop happens (basically it slows things down a bit but will no longer infinite loop)
	--5
	---Better error messages in Find/Detect Pairs, They can't be longer than 1028 characters for now. I can't seem to figure a good work around.
	---Margin, text-indent, (possibly padding not tested as much) now supported in html. Please see Special-Open Help for the proper tags.
	--6 
	---Book Config file now has a Build Options Section
	---ALso the Open>Book/Bible/Regex has some of its options saved to the config file of the TotheWord Program
	---Note the config file engine has been updated. It tries to update the file with an automatic edition if the setting doesn't exist. Programatically on close.
	--- Added <caps> and <overline> to Special Open see Special Open Help
	--7
	---Support for Unicode in Regex Rules and in Book>Special Oepn/Bible Editor > Open should now be correct. (Adjustments made to Regex Rules Engine
	--8
	---<bk_bname:([^>]+)> wasn't getting removed correctly on Bible build
	---Bible help was updated.
	---Added better Error reporting of Regex Pattern/Replace
	--9
	---Added () pairs and $NUMBER testing in Regex Editor > Check Regex Rules (It tries to ignore \\ and \( or \) in the pattern side)

D1.5
	--0
	---Worked on removing blank lines on Open > Bible (That were added due to #13#10 at the end of TStringList.) 
	---There is also a check box in Bible Editor. That removes other blank lines.
	---Added FinalRegex.BUILD to [file=, also modified file=all OR No file= to not work on The FinalRegex section which works on all the files joined together. This is where FinalRegex.BUILD section comes to work.
	--1
	---Made it so that if implicit is checked only like #:#, verse #, ver #, etc will be got in detection UNLESS Implicit Any Number is checked.
	--2
	---Problem with implict detection and a verse larger than the chapter number added "AND (CurrentChapter = 0)"
	---Alerts user to a reference out of range. It attempts to tell them if it is Starting Book, Ending Book, Starting Chapter, Ending Chatper, Starting Verse, Ending Verse.
	---Added Remove markups automatically on Build Book
	---Fixed introduced bug on Deletion of Previous module file.
	--3
	---Added to XHTML-LeftOvertags.txt now XHTML-LeftOvertagsBadRef.txt if there are bad Verse references (Note Chapter references if out of range are ignored in the Verse Detection code already)
	---At present these bad verses are still linked but are now in the the BadRef section of XHTML-LeftOvertagsBadRef.txt if Detect References is turned on. (I chose not to change chapters because it could cause problems with other code on other programs.
	---Also note the FinalRegex.BUILD that is in Regex Editor is only for Build Bibles. I added this to the hint.
	---Now if Find/Detect Paris, Find/Replace Pairs or References are not saved a Warning is given on close that allows Close to be Aborted or Ignore and continue close.
	--4
	---Find/Detect pairs should now have the right chapters, needs texting
	---Information List can now be seen through Main Menu > Show Info
	-----It can also be cleared
	-----This is were Errors from Find/Detect are shown
	-----This is where results from Find/Replace pairs are shown
	-----May be used in the future for other items. (Just let me know if there is a Popup message that would be better in this setting. However, we want to be careful not to have this form popup all the time sorta. It won't really slow down but it could get annoying. Though it can be left open.)
	---Escape Characters added see Find/Replace tab for the Escape Characters entry area. (New entry in Config file) (Not sure if this is a good location for it but the nice thing is Find/Replace is in every editor)
	-----Note it requires three Hoty Keys. Ctrl+C to prep the clipboard Ctrl+K to do the escape then Ctrl+V to paste it back. (Note this works on any text copied from any source/program as long as you click on TotheWord (If you click out of it) then Ctrl+K before pasting it back to where ever! :)
	---Added Random Id for Book Config, and a Random Id for Bible config
	---Added check on ID length if less than < 11 it warns of being Official and suggests the user uses the Random ID
	--5
	---Updated Verse Detection algorithm to only go 200 characters past bad reference for some context. (This affects Select and Detect and Loading a book and detecting.)
	---Updated the Map File function to Costas' widestring version of the GlobalUtiles StringListToStrW so that it now works instead of having NULL
	---Added Detect Ref All so it goes through the whole document. In theory it should skip paragraphs with Tables so that will need to be done manually at present.
	--6
	---Updated Detect Reference All to have user input of numbers like 100
	---Updated Detect Reference All to go backward 2 items just incase of Reference overlapping format.
	---Major update Verse Detection algorith should now handle tables. Even multiple tables in a row. (This addition may slow down overall detection but hopefully not by much.)
	---Verse Detection algorithm also works with footnotes as well.
	--7
	---Added LTR Select all option: It mainly affects Hebrew (I may eventually leave on always but for now kind of reviewing.)
	---New Edit file generated with Detected Reference links if Edit File is selected for Book.
	---Range detect error fixed in regards to like 1 Maccabees which is 99 which is past the 66 NT/OT Books. (If we support apocryphal links someday this will need changed.)
	--8
	---Added new file_footnote (changed to file_unique_footnote) to Special Open see the help file for further explanation.
	---Now Book and Bible config Editorial comments are multiline (Note Bible config comments don't need a # put before it is automatically added)
	---file_footnote changed to file_unique_footnote (better reflects that it now also has a unique number unless {ncnt} is put in the identifier)
	---{cnt:#} added to each unique_footnote or file_unique_footnote unless {ncnt} is added to the identifier (This happens during the import phase. Note the phases are 1. Regex Rules 2. Detect References 3. import (These phases happen twice in Overall end notes, in regular end notes 2. only happens once)
	---Special Open Help file has been updated with more information. 
	---footnote and note are kept for backwards compatibility but do not have a unique {cnt:#} so not recommended for use.
	---Added tag real-point-size to <font tag. so <font real-point-size=14> would be size 14 font.
	---Added Total-Matches.txt - should be sorted and merged the lines and the count. (THis is for Book Editor and Bible Editor Regex Rules Matches)
	---Updated Total-Matches so now all but ^FILE lines are ignored whether blank, //, [file, tabtab, etc.
	---NOT MATCHED File now shows 0 Regex matches instead of the bug amount from the previous matched File.
	--9 
	---Internal reworking of Find/Replace specifically Format then Regex
	---More internal reworking and speeding up of Find/Replace/Replace All
	---More internal reworking. (Only affects Replace All (Format/Regex Priority)
	----Addition of Character Line Max in Regex Tab area of Find/Replace
	----Addition of Item max in Regex Tab
	----Addition of Regex Priority Full Length (Needs tested but only for Regex Priority it is for SingleLine or other random things if you need to swap from some place in document to bottom or top.
	----Addition of Character Length actual of text being worked through in Regex Tab (For Regex Priority it should stay the same as Character Line Max in Format it will vary but max at Character Line Max) 
	----These may go away but they are good for testing adjusting.
	----Addition of a Timer now displayed on end of Replace All for both Format and Regex Priority.
	---Added Instant content to the Regex Editor. Trying typing [ or / or ' and it should get the format and input ready.

D1.6
	--0
	---Update version info
	---Minor adjustments to internals of Regex Priority (trying to use less functions)
	--1
	---Fixed unicode with other languages like Greek in cached language for Detect References
	---Various internals speed ups for Regex Priority
	---Made so the interface doesn't update on Build of Book (hopefully it will be faster and yet work good)
	---saving to RVF for theWord now works in the Delphi version. 
	---More informative on the footnote error id and tag in the XHTMLLeftOverTagsBadRef file, also the result file will dispaly ERROR in red with a message just search for ERROR in Find/Replace.
	--2
	---Updated Find/Dectect pairs now saves Any Implicit Number setting (tries to maintain backward compatibility with previous FRP)
	---Updated Find/Detect Pairs should no longer flash on and off.
	---Warns on Add Pair of Find/Detect pair if footnote or table are included (you can select in a cell just not the whole table I believe)
	---Surogate pair unicode now support finally whew
	---added swap character(s) word pairs under Extra Edit (note they are really regex pairs that operate on the present setting of Find/Replace)
	---I would like to add this same feature into a special Regex Rule but still thinking on this.
	---Swap characters tab added, Swap check box added in Find/Replace (replace area), this works with the find options and the replace options (not the regex though in replace)
	-----See the on screen info in the Swap Characters tab for more info in how it works.
	---Detect VRefs All now works with even just one line (item) in the file (it was failing before on this.)
	---<:>Title in Special Open hopefully will be the right style from now instead of the random red, or other things.
	---A bit of update in regards to <br> or <br /> in the importer
	---Now <:> automatically removes '\[p ?(\d+|\w+)>' AND '\[p ?page(\d+|\w+)>'
	--3
	---Spead up character swap and added more information to the Swap tab
	---Strip diacritics in Swap characters
	---Lowercase in Swap characters (CAREFUL affects regex portion as well)
	---Hash tags enabled for Non-Regex Mode (Regex Mode still available) Hash table mode is best used when full match is desired. 
	---All of Standard Formatting > Font and Color has been sped up. TODO is the rest of Standard Formatting
	---Find/REplace count better when doing Swap Characters (If no swap characters match then it doesn't count)
	---A few updates to make sure Regex Mode is working right as well.
	--4
	---# was being removed from <slf> links so bookmarks weren't working right for manual bookmarks added via Bookmark editor in TotheWord
	---Book build should now be faster due to a change in updating the RichViews.
	---# is now removed and then added back in later for <bkm>....</bkm> or for manual bookmarks added via Bookmark editor in TotheWord
	---More than one topic can now have identical bookmark names and still work.
	--5
	---<rmv> tag added for support inside the <:> or <link> so that you can remove text from the topic tree. The content remains inside the content portion with the tags stripped away.
	---<rmv_tw> added to Special Open import for html, xhtml. 
	--6
	---maxverses added to Bible config
	---<rmv> can now span multiple lines as well as other tags like <str>, <mrph> etc. 
	--7	
	---If there is a [\r\n]+ it is replace with a space inside of the topic tree for <:> or <link> this should make things easier overall
	---</:> has been added to the TTW interface.
	---You may mix single line <:> with multi line <:>....return....</:>. However, <:>test</:>text<:>test2 won't work when on the same line One or the other not both on a single line. Also note 
	---You may even use <:>text text</:>text to shorten a topic  (NOTE if this is really helpful I may fix this for </c> but it is complex to fix as of right now </c> can't be used to shorten a topic)
	---</:_tw> has been added to importer
	---ALT+5 is the hotkey for </:> in TTW.
	---b Fixed when <:> was only in the module or the last topic in the module. Also built in a speed up for when there are no </:> or if from that point on no more. 
	---c Updated page marker removal in <:> and <link> for topic tree
	---- Added em dash — to <ref> 
	---- Added em dash to <ref> in precheck
	---- Added em dash — to <bcv> 
	---- Added em dash to <bcv> in precheck
	--8
	---<:>Title - fixed being red on 2nd load of Special Open
	---b
	----Restored error note to TTW interface for unmatched footnote links
	---c
	----<chp_xref:whole> generates the chapter like 1-31 Used like: <RX 1.1.<chp_xref:whole>> so then the RX becomes <RX 1.1.1-31>
	----Don't start search from top check box added to Find/Detect pairs.
	----Fixed it so if DNS was not part of an earlier Find/Detect Pair it automatically is off.
	---d
	----When Detect ALL is pressed Implicit ANY Detection is turned off.
	----Reworked the conversion back to RawByteString for Books, BIbles got changed to UTF8 only, they are also loaded that way so no need to detect UTF8. THis should be simpler in the long run.
	----Added s to strong.dct now is strongs.dct in the Bible config
	----When Detect ALL is pressed Implicit Detection is turned off.
	----Adjusted Detect area size
	---e
	----Added turn map off for Bible build
	--9
	---Upgraded to Delphi 11.2
	---b
	----Reworked UnicodeToHtmlDataRawByteString function. Seems to hopefully work now. (Only affects Book Special Open...)
	---c
	----If you need to add to a page number on the <a id=.... side then use this format. <a id="page9++2"></a> this will cause the first number to increase by the second number. The result would be [p11>
	----If you need to subtract from a page number on the <a id=.... side then use this format. <a id="page9--2"></a> this will cause the first number to decrease by the second number. The result would be [p7>
	---d Regex editor, ttwregex.rules now support multiple files in [file=  use the divider | and then put the next filename so [file=filename|filename|filename]
	---e Pre-export now works with tables like for <bcv> , probably other tags will do better as well with tables.
	---f
	----Added style="text-align:right/left/center/justify">
	----Adjusted under class there is  rvps (hopefully does better with more paragraph settings) -- if there is problem in the future (Does not affect style="text-align)
	---g
	---- em now supported in style for special open the formula used is px = em * font-size(base = 16px); from here: https://www.calculatorway.com/pixel/em-to-px-converter.html
	---- px and em now support these numbers #.# .# and #
	---- limited style support for <div> such as <div style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-left:2em; margin-right:0em; margin-top:1.5em;"> px is also supported
	---- Worked on <div style a bit more the SpaceBefore and SpaceAfter needed fixed.
	---h	
	---- Find/Detect now should work with text in a cell. Note if you select multiple cells it will warn you that it spans multiple lines and this won't work.
	----<th in table can now have style setting
	----<td should be able to as well.
	---- also in p and th or td padding can be simplified if for all sides by doing padding:3px;
	---- <li also can have style setting now.
	--style attributes can now have like margin-top:3%;
	---- Fixed it so Find/Detect works inside of tables correctly.
	---i	
	---- Find/Detect was only getting first occurance in a table now it should get them all.
	---- If Not from Top is checked in Find/Detect and you are working on a table go in this order: 
                  Left to right one row at a time.
		[1][2][3]
		[4][5][6]
		[7][8][9]
	---- Two forms of code for Detect F5 and Pairs to accomodate Tables (Basically the two forms are mixed together) Hopefully can be simplified someday
	---- odd − minus sign added to Verse detection for inside TotheWord or in import.

	----<span has been added Note I don't recommend doing alignment styles here, font settings are recommended: font-family|font-size|color|background-color|font-style|font-weight|text-decoration|text-transform|vertical-align	
	----more work on <span hopefully better
	----more work on <span to deal with paragraph items
	---c
	---- Found bugs that were causing indentation to go awry. Note span at this point supports alignment but must be tested (It may be removed)
	----When -# is used for firstline indent the overall indent is increase on that line by the negative. (Seems to work ok)
	----<span only supports font settings
	----font sizes: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large are supported they are 4,6,8,10,12,14,16
	---d
	---updates to the <ul tag type="..." now supports some additions, here are all of what is supported: disc, circle, square, none, lower-greek, number-leading-zero, a, A, i, I, 1

	---fixes on <li so it doesn't have an extra return between lines
	---e	
	----<li and <ol, and <ul works better but can't handle <ol followed by <ul then </ul> then </ol>
	--2
	--- Made it so DetectReference uses TopEditor instead of regular. (I thought this wasn't needed but I was wrong.)
	--- Too many changes in dealing with <li, <ol, <ul, and <p inside of these to list. (Not completely fixed but much better.) If you get a <p that doesn't work right inside of a <li... <p...</p></li> try putting the </li> before the <p> (I know not the best but I have spent countless hours on this already.
	---b
	---- Detect All fixed (restored it to just RichViweEdit not RichViewEdit.TopLevelEditor
	---- Detect/Pairs stayed fine	
	---- Detect Selected (F5) made it like Detect/Pairs so it can handle outside of a table, inside of table, including a table
	---- These should all detect reference on footnotes as well.
	---c
	---- F7 = F6 then F5 (hint in Add Detect Pairs)
	---- F8 = F3  shortcut key to help with Detect Pairs
	---- Detect has Alt check (this allows previous verse detection links to be overwritten much like holding down Alt+F5) This can be useful during  a DetectAll
	---- Detect Pairs can be Autosaved (setting saved to config.ini)
	---d
	---- <p inside of <li seems to be working better (Not 100% satisfied with <ul inside of <ol but it is what it is at this point. 
	--3
	---- Speed improvements to Array - Stage of Book Build (<slf> only works in Build - stage but it was searching for the <slf> tag so slowing things down)
	---- Feedback during the <slf> stage in searching for topics and bookmarks that may be in the <slf>....||....</slf> tag The Information form should show if there is no match and try to explain where to look.
	---- Scroll position feedback should be better for like <slf|bcv|ref|etc....

	---- Standard Formatting now has Paragraph > 10p FirstLine Indent (For All)
	---e
	---- <bkm> can now be inside of footnotes. Basically everything but <:>, <c>, <link>, <tlink> can be inside of footnotes (the last two could be should not that is <link> and <tlink>)
	---- be careful where you place <bkm> in footnotes since it will chop off what shows in a footnote link hover.
	---- the internal links for footnotes are 
		---- bookmark: 'ttwFOOTnote' + IntToStr(note_cnt) 
		---- and link is: tw://[self]?tid=' + IntToStr(topic_sub_i)+ '#ttwFOOTnote' + IntToStr(note_cnt)+'-'

	---- Find/Detect on Run All Pairs now shows # of # when finding.
	--5
	---- Added Picture on its own Paragraph into the Config of the Build (This all is for theWord which will automatically resize an image on its own paragraph if needed based on the Book view size.)
	-----There are a few settings for it Check for Picture on Paragraph (check hint)
	----- Next Width or Height if enabled the picture must be larger than this value in pixels for moving it to its own Paragraph to be enabled. 
	---b
	---- Fix on the Picture on Paragraph toggle (wasn't loading correctly)
	---- SpecialOpen Import now lets you know if some Footnotes are left over. It tells you the tag and the footnote text in the XHTML-LeftOverTagsBadRefs.txt File

	---- Alert to Special Open XHTML-LeftOverTagsBadRefs alerts if a <div style not support, more info also for alignment, and other style items
	---- Now Info area opens with XHTML-LeftOverTagsBadRefs after a Special Open is complete. Includes Edited Files and Matches Files if enabled
	---d
	---- Standard Formatting > General > Remove Protection of Styles (Make it so you can edit "locked" text.) -- sometimes when text is copied from theWord particularly books in non-edit mode the text can be locked. This helps unlock it.
	---e
	---- Fix <ref> and (Old method of <bcv> rarely used) to support Psalm #:#-#a (the a was giving problems) (Fixed in build and pre-export check)
	---f
	---- <ref> now works correctly with chapter like <ref>Ezekiel 22</ref> however it does not work with <ref>Ezekiel 21-22</ref>
	--6
	---a
	---- Recommended if you need to encapsule <p or <div then use <footnote_tw id="unique_footnote-0">...<p...<div....</footnote_tw> so instead of using <p or <div as your footnote add <footnote_tw id before the <p or <div that is the main one. However as soon as <footnote_tw is used then <p and <div will not work for footnotes on this module. Sorry either it is footnote_tw or the other can't be both.
	--- A good regex solution for this either for <p or <div is to do:
		 <p whatever footnote is replace with </footnote_tw><footnote_tw id="unique_footnote-0"><p> 
		Another regex '$'	'</footnote_tw>'	[roSingleLine]  --- this treats the whole file as a single line so then you can add the closing </footnote_tw>
		Another regex to remove the starting </footnote_tw> that is not needed so '^(.*?)</footnote_tw>'	'$1'	[roSingleLine] --- this treats the whole file as a single line so you can remove that pesky starting </footnote_tw>
	---b
	---- <str> was not working right in Commentary so hopefully fixed it by turning off (modidx <> 2) in two places inside the <str> detection area. (Not sure if this affects anything else so far so good from the little testing I did.)
	---- Added R check box that reverses a string in Find/Replace this is useful for Hebrew 
	---- Special open now has <ltr> and <rtl> plus <span also supports dir:rtl or dir:ltr in style this is text level.. <p, <dir, <li, etc still support direction:ltr or direction:rtl this is paragraph level..
	---- Added in Build Book > Devotional (It says recommended if devotional is checked in config. Note though any book can be used for a devotional such as Dictionary, Map, or General Book as far as I know.) 
	---- Devotional section added in Config
	---- SQL section added in Config (Use at one's own risk - it can be helpful though if you need to finalize some items in SQL.)
	---- Fixed font embed
	--7
	---a Additions to <ref> and <bcv> in the Pre-export test engine and Build engine now also support: Chapter span without : <ref>Numbers 3-4</ref>; Single Chapter books: <ref>Jude 4-5</ref> <ref>Jude 4</ref> <ref>Jude 4b</ref> <ref>Jude 4b-6</ref> <ref>Jude 4b-6c</ref> (Important note <bcv> only works in this manner if under the Detect tab <bcv> OFF: is checked then the Auto VRefDetect code is not used instead the References are used from the References tab.
	---b If in Detect Use org bcv and Costas' bcv is checked then both methods are used, otherwise just Costas' is used. It may take just a bit longer. Not org bcv is influenced by the references in the References tab 
	---- Added support that strips out " *\([^)]*\) *" inside of <ref> or <bcv> on the left side
	---c Fixed (the difference between ref||words was being ignored in bcv and needed fixed.)
	
D1.8
	--0
	---a Addition of Search/Replace in import regex rules this is a basic engine that doesn't use a regex engine just a quick search/replace engine. It has a few tags, roNoReplaceAll = find first instance, roIgnoreCase, roSingleLine. To activate this mode put {regex_off} inside the {} tags This engine can be used in _IN_ also if so desired. Also the #13 , #10, #9, #0 will be turned into return, newline, tab or null. This engine is very beneficial for replacing returns,newlines on a whole file which is a huge single line. Recommended for this in Bibles. (See the Regex Editor mode for more helps in the interface)
	---b About files are now exported as RTF and now support images.
	---c Adjusted this statement hmms but may be wrong needs more testing: if (fli_px < 0) AND ((ml_px = 0) OR (Gdiv_L_indent > 0))  then //use to be just fli_px < 0 now added AND ((ml_px = 0) OR (Gdiv_L_indent > 0)) (may need to change)
	--- Fix FastMM dll
	---d FastMM dll should not be needed in normal use only debugging.
	--1
	---a Added timers to Build on modules (dic, books, commentary, map, devotional) it shoud show up in the information list.
	---b TopIdArr swapped with TopIdDictionary added this should speed up the <slf> links for topics.
	---c BkmTopIdArr swapped with BkmTopDictionary added this should speed up the <slf> links for topics + bkm or bkm
	---- <link> and <tlink> will now also keep the content of <str>(.*?)</str>, morph, slf, bcv, and not just the ones that have <slf>.*?\|\|(.*?)</slf> which will be kept but also the others.
	---- Array stage should go faster since now <str>, <mrph>, <slf>, <bcv>, <ref> are ignored since we just need to get <c>, <:>, <link> or <tlink> and <bkm> to build the arrays.
	---- attempt to bring TotheWord onto screen if offscreen.
	---d Help F1 is for programming TRichView and is not needed for TotheWord users (It has been made invisible)
	---- Help file for Regex Editor updated
	---e The error reporting has been updated for Duplicate topics, bkm when they affect a <slf>
	---- Information List now has File, Edit
	---- Build information is automatically saved under the same file as the module in the same location with -b.txt attached.
	---f Split topic+bkm and bkm only hashtables into two separate hashtables so as to speed up searches during build.
	---g Improved the information list to include topics for each time amount. Also the Build, and Array overall are now timed.
	---UTF8 encoding on Build info save
	--2
	---a Many updates to the configuration area of Book and Bible - mainly hints, also a few features that had been missed such as r2l, nfmid, version required (was updated) for Books; Bibles version required entry was updated, Font size was corrected to -10 to +10
	---- Added "Keep Empty Lines" checkbox to the Bible build this assumes the user meant to have the empty lines.

	---a TRichView version 21 -- File > Open > Book Editor > Open New *.html; *.htm; *.xhtml (This will let you load this item just basic funcationality on this portion.
	---- New Special Open, tags like <:_tw> etc work right still, Extra Edit now has a tool to help with Fontsize to px, em, per
            ---- Use these in the css file to set a standard overall setting for font, etc.
		html * {
		  /* 13px = 10 size in TRichView*/

	--- Special Open has more in Info Form.
	--- New Special Open Help file added Mainly Footnote Text
	---c Book Non-free id hidden not needed in TotheWord
	--1
	---a Special Open and New Special Open updated <bk_tw> and <chp_tw>
	---- Note <bk> does not work with Pre-export check only Actual Build
	---- <bk> now works with Org <bcv> and Costas' bcv.
	---b {math} and {roman_num} added 
	----for math use math{1+20}, you can use the signs +,-,*,/ and the numbers can be - or + up to four decimal places
	----for roman_num use roman_num{20} 
	--2
	---a <twhyp> and <twbkm> have been added also to Special Open and New Special Open as <twhyp_tw>, and <twbkm_tw>
            ----Please see New Special Open OR Special Open > Special Tags for how both work!
	---b Fix <twbkm> bug
	---- Add buttons for <twhyp> and <twbkm> and shortcuts. Also see updated New Special Open Help
	---c <twhyp> now accounts for unicode and even Manuscript M.
	---d <a href now supports tw:// as a path and base path is not included on this. This affets New Special Open (maybe Special Open not tested)
	--- CSS styles should now work better. No need to comment out styles that don't work.
	---e inline style= in CSS on the New Special Open got broke with another fix, now working again.
	---- Speed increase on RegexRules, and DetectVRef, no longer are their popup windows in these instead the information is displayed in Information Form.
	---f Made it so a Regex rule could have ' inside of the Replace on a Regex rule.
	----Speed increase on Mark Non-Links
	---g Added Replace All from Caret
	---h removed some settings from Book build that theWord does internally.
	---i Updated to Delphi 11.3
	--3
	---a Verse Detection no longer automatically adds for Special Open or New Special Open if the reference is bad.
	---- Extra Edit, has a paragraph alignment "fast" replace
	---- Standard Formatting > General > Remove Protection Text/Paragraph (should now be good for paste from locked theWord books)
	---- Added to Find/Dectect References ( a tool for removing links just check Rmv Link and it will be added to the pair)
	---b Added UI - Update Implicit to Verse Detect if checked when a user double clicks a reference link it will update the implicit check box
	---- Added Show to Verse Detect if checked the detection process will be shown.
	---c Verse Detect was resizing text on fresh start up of TTW then Detecting
	---- UI in Verse Detect must now also include Alt Key press (I tried Ctrl but it tries to popup an app to open the link) The implicit check is now also turned on.
	---d Fixed Alt press on Double Click
	---- Added warning message on Rmv Link
	---- Chapter drop down was not getting updated on Double Click + Alt
	---e Now Rmv Link removes links on F7 press, and its location has been moved.
	---f trim() is used more often in <:>subjects, <link> etc, please test that it doesn't remove too much
	---g Added Ordinal numbers to Verse Detection 
	---h moved <hide_topic> and explained better. <hide_topic> tag should be inside of the topic but not on the <:> line or inside the </:>. The reason is if a user clicks off "Include Topic in Content" then it will be as if it never existed.
	--4
	----a Now in Book Editor for Open, Ignore Style, Use TTW Style or use Source Style applies to everything in the Open category of Book Editor.
	----b Update to greek.lng for Esther and 2 Kings (I think), Work around in Book Editor > Open area which is #8. This helps fixed a Formatting issue that affects ReplaceAll
	--5
	----a Added build.greek.font, and build.hebrew.font to Book config (theWord will ignore it if it is not used.) THis is used in twAlpha
	----b Fix Detect Verse Reference in Special Open/ New Special Open
	--6
	----a Examples > TCENT Bible information included. 
	----- Fixed mapping a NT BIble. It had the wrong line count and needed them removed.
	----b Added Open any TEXT file to Bible Editor and Book editor
	----- Added Word Wrap to Bible and Book Editor. These settings are saved on close and reused on open.
	----c Verse Detection fixes so First Timothy 3:15 and Song of Solomon 1:1 works well
	----d Updated Verse detection fixes so that accounting for John 1:1; 1 Chr 1:2 was not affecting Acts 22:1, 2, 7, 9
	----e Updated Find/Replace pairs so they have more settings for S, R, N and also the checkboxes in Swap Character(s).
	----- Updated Bible Config Editor for Verse Rules, Tags
	----f  Find/Replace addition of Replace - All Pairs which starts at Caret
	----- Added CO to Find which comments out Regex automatically for you. It is saved with Find/Replace Pairs. (This is what it comments out at present which should be all: \^$.|?*+()[]{}-#!)
	----g Updated f/r pairs to now include the caret setting in Replace box. This affects Replace All Button, Replace - All Pairs right click menu in Pairs, Replace All - All Pairs right click menu in Pairs
	------ Added the ability to move pairs up and down in F/R and F/D
	------ Added the ability to replace a pair in F/R
	----h cleaned up <bk>, <chp>, and another I missed from <:>, <link>, <tlink>, <bkm>
	----i Added the Alt setting to the Find/Detect Pairs which allows for overwriting previous verse detection links if desired.
	---- Addition of Success/Failure results to Find/Detect Pairs
	----j Fixed Any Implicit hopefully, added in Chapter detection in Verse Detection
	----- fixed import verse detection, including chapter detection 
	----k
	----- Addition to Implicit which is Chapter 0 this is best if you are selecting the following chapters 1; 2; 3; 4 etc. but if you mean to do verses like 1, 2, 3, 4 it is best to have a chapter set. Otherwise it tries to get a chapter from the text.
	----- Fix Hebrew issue with using Uniscribe engine
	----- Fixed so Find/Replace pair, Find/Detect Pair "save trigger" should only come on when it is needed. (May need more testing. It was misfiring at the end after an open without any additions before.
	----l Verse detection import works better with John 1, 1 Timothy 3 however, John 1, is IGNORED so this is noted in information. However, John 1; 1 Timothy 3 works right. This does not affect John 1,1 test
	---- Verse detection in TTW works better with John 1, 1 Timothy 3 however, John 1, is MISLINKED so this is noted in information. Its link is John 1:1. However, John 1; 1 Timothy 3 works right. This does not affect John 1,1 test.
	----m Fix to Internal VDetect from <> to => on a test.
	----n Fix for Implicit detect on numbers 3, 2, 1 now should work like the line (implicit Gen 3): 3), test test 
	----- Fix for Windows text engine fixed by Sergey now updated. Uniscribe text engine is recommended with Hebrew/English though. So that is the new norm.
	----o Alt+Double Click on a Ref was making the chapter off by 1 since I added That in version k
	----p fixed Chapter on Run Detect All Pairs it was -1 off since version k
	---- Typo fix in Book Editor > Book Config "verision" to "version"
	---- Also a link to "Latest Version" 
	--7
	----a Now "Special Open" and "New Special Open" Do not require Regex rules for loading. However, then Regex Rules are ignored.
	----b-c Book Config now has the Devotional SQL included so the user can modify it. 
	------ Book Config cleans out settings on the load of a new config file just incase it was an older file and didn't have all the settings.
	------ {regex_off} no longer triggers Regex Match to error. However, {regex_off} count may not be accurate if "roNoReplaceAll" is used in [].
	--8
	----a Interface updates to the Bible Editor, with better hints and explanations.
	----- Updates to topic tree at left of screen. Now saves its width. Also Load Topics button moved there for <:>, <c>, <link>, <tlink>, also doesn't clear but may recommend a reload of topics. Also Tree View has a few updates, doesn't clear unless item count changes.
	----- Changelog adjusted so that new information is always at the bottom.
	----b Extra edit has some more font replacement based off of Costas tw Util
	--9
	----a-b Book Editor > Clean Unused Fnts & Generates Fonts & Paragraph Style List now works better and if you click on a style it will try to take you to that in the main editor. It will also attempt to go down through the items with that style. It also warns you if there are some items that may not be standard.
	------ Tools > Stripped Html to Clipboard has updated regex.
D2.0
	---0
  	----a Background color can now be changed for Book, Bible, or Regex Editor
	----Config should no longer warn but has defaults.
	----b clicking on <str>.. or <morph... without previously selecting a word will now generate <str></str> and <morph></morph>
	----c Colors in build and other places should have a lighter version of the main color chosen for the Editor
	---- strong.h, strong.g for supporting new feature in twsneak-peek
	---1
	----a Working on 64bit version -- seems to have some errors in building books, etc. much to do here
	---2
	----a Refactoring for speed and code cleaning and worked more on interface Color
	----b more refactoring and speed improvements for Final Build of Books.
	----c small speed improvement, fixing <bkm>NASB</bkm> was not working right with <slf>&#NASB-||NASB</slf> after some speed improvements. It is now working right. Added NOT FOUND to the search for reminder in the build generated file
	---3
	----a Added checker for Bible Build, it happens as the Bible is built. Now Information is shown during Bible as well. It tries to tell you if there is a misbalance, nesting (for start tag), and Case problem on tags.
	---- these are the tags it checks for so far:  ('<font', '</font>'), ('<rtf', '</rtf>'),('<a', '</a>'),  ('<sup>', '</sup>'), ('<sub>', '</sub>'), ('<rtl>', '</rtl>'), ('<ltr>', '</ltr>'),  ('<i>', '</i>'), ('<b>', '</b>'), ('<u>', '</u>'), ('<s>', '</s>'), ('<RF', '<Rf>'), ('<TS', '<Ts>'), ('<FI>', '<Fi>'), ('<FO>', '<Fo>'),('<FR>', '<Fr>'),  ('<NB>', '<Nb>'), ('<ST>', '<St>') Note these are all case sensitive (Also becareful of using NB or ST in the text unless intentional and then follow the case that is required. These may be best left to verse.rules)
	---4
	----a Fixed an extra linebreak that was being added to the first tag of a line such as <str>, <twhyp>, <link> etc. if the tag had a change of format (font) internally 
	----- Added more error checking code so as to alert the user to some possible problems including no <:> in a General Book, Dictionary, etc and now it should close up cleanly
	----- a bit of refactoring of code.
	----b Additions to Book > Build area: You can now choose how many seconds are between each Info message (there was perhaps too many and causing a slow down.) You can also choose to have topics included in this or excluded. Same for commentary. If you want to see them all put in -1 seconds.
	----- Status messages during the build were also reduced as well.
	----c For info messages on build: The second timer works this way, it will show a status if that particular part of the build took longer than 5 seconds. Well many don't so you can go for awhile without a message. So now there is also an incremental counter based on that same second delay that will show the topic, etc that the build is progressing on. If you don't like this simply put in -1 secs and you will be good.
	----d Fix <slf>, <bkm> array stage search indicator, it wasn't triggering which was causing some <slf> to fail. 
	----- Add topic to error notes. 
	----- Note about recommended Date for Bibles and Books added, too often what file one is on gets lost in the builds. It is recommended to always include this. (However, it is always internal in the file if it is not included in the file name.)
	----5
	----- Removed a regex count from error build, not needed
	----- cleaned up some of the format checking code for Find/Replace
	----- Added a basic replace to Replace in Find/Replace (uses StringReplace instead of Regex, however the only setting is Ignore case.)
	----6
	----- Bible Editor now, can display a line of the Bible text in the window below the BIble Editor, it can have original, Verse rules applied, Stripped Tags (Verse Rules are from the Bible Config area)
	----7
	----- No longer must have Regex rules file for Loading Bible with special open.
	----- UTF8 requirement added to the text files
	----- When Building Map turns off if #.#.#. is not on a line or has #.#.#. but is empty
	----- Fixed Name/date error on saving Bible
	----- If Trim problem in Map files appears it gives a bit more information but it shouldn't appear because we should have stopped it before it came up.
	----- Case/MisBalance on Tag checker updated extensively
	----8
	----- Case/Misbalance on Tag checker updated more, now Case-Error really includes, misbalance and nesting. (Some speed ups hopefully)
	----- BadUnicode Checking also included now.
	----- Check for regex in Bible build
	----- On Screen only check
	----- Stop before Building if errors
	----- Ignore tags for example <wt> is the only ignored one for now
	----- much more.
	----- templates added.
	----9
	----- On Bible check when you have a regex with a comment like (?#unusedStrong) that will be used in the Checker information rather than the whole regex in the Error comment.
	----- multiple lines can now be loaded in the Verse Panel so you can test those multiple line problems or see more text quickly.
D 2.1
	----0
	----- Added Go to NR (Next Regex) in Verse Panel this helps you jump through the text looking for issues, then click on the start of the next line and start again. (I could make it so it is just a Click again, however if word wrap is off then the highlight jumps you to the end of a long line and it messes up where you are at visually) You should be able to check multiple lines at a time as well.
	----- There are two new templates in Templates for Highlight Regex and Bible Regex Check
	----1
	----- Standardized table, cells, etc in Formatting now checks for nil cells was causing an error, hopefully sped up as well. 
	----2
	----- Major overhaul of the Bible editor interface, since formatting is not really needed in the Bible editor mode we are now using TMemo instead of TRichViewEdit. Which if you load a text file it will be much much faster.
	----- This also meant that the Bible Editor needs a different Search/Replace based on TMemo instead of TRichViewEdit (By the way there is a huge speed difference but remember TMemo does not have formatting like TRichViewEdit) so better not to compare between the two. It isn't even like comparing apples and oranges more like meat and bread.
	----3
	-----Check for empty tags and report/skip in Book Build alerts with a "NO CONTENT ERROR" 
	-----Notify user if Module name has Unicode in the name of a Book hopefully one day it will work but for now SQL is not working right with it.
	----4
	----- Fixed a sql error on Embedding font, bit of clean up as well. (attempted to make TotheWord disonnect from a failed SQL database but couldn't solve as of now. User will need to manual delete as before.)
	----- config.ini should auto make itself now on close if deleted. (Kinda like a reset)
	----5 Adjust a Reformat back to Format in Delete blank lines (was causing error) - not a good speed improvement here
	----- Move a Result (True/False) in Embedding fonts
	----- Export view in Book Build is now in the Right panel instead of the bottom. Better for settings in left panel. Pre-export view is still there as well depending on if you have Show Export View clicked, or if you just clicked Check Pre-Export
	----6
	----- Normal Search now works in Find/Replace for Bible Editor (Down/Up) supported by PosCR and ReversePos
	----- Now Normal or Regex search in Bible Editor is enabled depending on what was last left on on close down.
	----- Colors should now save per each Editor. 
	----- Ctrl+Down Arrow added for Next Result in Bible Editor
	----- Ctrl+Click hint added to Bible Verse Panel was only on a check box before.
	----7
	----- Zoom added for Bible Editor, also Book Editor and Regex editor now support Ctrl+NumPad + for zoom, and NumPad - for opposite
	----- Menus removed in Bible and Regex Editor, added Bible Options, Regex Options Menus
	----- Background Color now includes Auto this was going to black it appeared to be set to clNone which would then show the clWindow or whatever the editor was at a bit hard to determine. It should now save and load with TtW
	-----8
	----- Font color was messing up in Bible Editor
	----- addExtra Spacing turned off in StripTags
	----- Verse Panel, now saves, size, font, color, style in Bible Editor
	----- Additions to Verse Panel, Font, +, - for zoom
	----- Resize Bar added for Verse Panel does not save yet, you wouldn't think a little resize bar would be so complex lol.
	----- IMPORTANT NOTE: Please report bugs in the forum, it is too hard to track them in email. Your bug report may get lost. Also please assume there is a lot of code in TtW, (there is). So please be very clear and explain the procedure to reproduce a bug. It may be very clear in your mind since you just saw it but when it is "one line of text or a real short explanation of the bug" it gets very complex to know what is being discussed and this bug may get ignored. 
	-----9
	-----Switched from TMemo to TRichEdit to support longer lines in Bible Editor (not as fast though hmms)
	-----New now works in BIble Editor. 
D2.2
	-----0-a
	----- TTextEditor replaced RichEdit for the Bible Editor (note RichEdit was left elsewhere in place of TMemo)
	----- Most things should work again in BIble Editor, I still have not solved Hebrew displaying correctly outside of line 1, not it does not actually mess up the content
	----- Wordwrap if turned on - on restart causes an error, please ignore and continue. If you can't please set wordwrap to 0. I personally don't recommend wordwrap seems to slow things down. (I hope to fix the error on load or new)
	----- Find/Replace should be working again for BIble Editor. 
	----- Please let me know of anything that is broken still???? 
	----- Testing need to see if a .ont file that is loaded and about removed will build. I just ran out of time for this build.
	-----1-2
	----- So much has changed in Bible Editor, Regex Editor, now lines are added, using TTextEditor component
	----- Themes: See Bible Options or Regex Options (complex to modify try to study out what is there, sorry can't offer help on this, too complex)
	----- Highlighter same as themes (complex to modify try to study out what is there, sorry can't offer help on this, too complex) I recommend using RegexRules-highlighter.JSON for RegexEditor and tWBible-highlighter for Bible Editor, similar for Themes
	----- Book Editor now has Book Options this is for editor color, Background Color under Format now just changes the background.	
	------Bible/Regex Editor has right click popup
	-----3
	-----Background Auto Color added to Options menu for each Editor
	-----Line numbers 1,2,3,4,5 instead of 1,|,10
	-----Ctrl + G added for Go To Line
	-----Wordwrap set to False in Bible Build is nolonger used because the Lines don't wrap internally
	-----Ruler hidden in Bible, Regex Editor view, not needed
	-----New tWBible-Dark Theme added thanks Steve

	-----7-8
	-----Show VRs in Bible Verse Panel causes the Verse Rules applied to be visible in the Verse Panel. However, when you click on "Go to Nxt Regex M" it will only stop on verse rules if they are visible. Otherwise it will only stop on Strip Tags with problems.
	-----The interface colors have been updated at Swap and Detect tab.  A few other places were set to Inactive for Config files that are uneditable.	
	-----config internally now can be not-case sensitive for sections, id str etc.
	-----Verse rules now only get regenerated when there is a modification to Verse rules in BIble Editor config
	-----Bible/Regex editor Find/REplace now has pairs
	-----ENDFILE, endfile, EndFile, eNdFiLe these will close a fold in RegexEditor case does not matter. If highlighter gets supported to close an empty line then we may switch to that. But we will try to keep this for backward compatibility	
	----- Added Next, Prev, Expand, Collapse fold in right click
	-----Updated save, various pairs, Bible editor, Regex editor (fixed a problem in regex editor)

D2.3
	-----0
	-----Added an option to turn on/off the Final Regex Build which joins multiple Bible files on Special open as one. (If there is already one file no need to turn this on.) Also only turn on if you actually need it.
	-----Numbers added to references_names.ref for those situation where you use the number as a name.
	-----Normalize added to Regex rules as {normalize} also math, roman_num are now show in interface as well (Normalize is a good idea when working with languages that have accents, like Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic it puts the text in the standard. Not academic standard but the standard for everyone else which is more common.)
	-----In replace of Regex \t has been added and now is substituted with #9 which is tab
	-----1
	----- I broke Regex \r, \n when I added \t now it is fixed
	----- More time information is done with Special Open in Bible Editor. ALso new edit box for seconds between info messages. -1 for all. Note more messages = slower build time. (-1 would be good for figuring out what search/replace uses the most time.)
	----- Edit box in book type for Seconds for book editor on New Special Open but not on Special Open is set to 5secs may be linked later..
	-----2
	----- Added some of the Bible Build settings to the config
	----- Updates to Find/Replace in the Bible/Regex it was in a sense always on SingleLine mode which was slowing it way down and causing items not to work right.
	----- Find/Replace and ReplaceAll now have better status updates in the status bar in BIble/Regex Find/Replace
	-----3
	----- Skip empty regex in Bible Build check with Regex.
	----- SingleLine in Bible Find/Replace causes the check to be done on the whole Bible as a string, which is needed for \r\n (This needs some refinement like these are added per regex line but that is tricky for loading the text.) So for now SingleLine is the way to test the whole Bible.
	----- Same for Go to Next Regex M (this will cause from the cursor to the end of the Bible to be loaded.) I thought about triggering this if a Regex had \r or \n, but then there are times when you want to check the whole line with ^ and $. Plus same as above with final Bible check, hard to trigger loading whole Bible from the regex test code due to how it was built around multiLine.
	----- Empty regex in Go to Next Regex M are ignored.
	----- Various fixes, etc.
	-----4
	------ Verse tag was checking for "<a" instead of "<a " also "<rtf" instead of "<rtf " these were updated so as to handle tags like <AT> 
	-----5
	------ Comments can now be put into the regex of the Bible Verse Panel, and in the Bible Build regex panel
	-----6 
	------ Bible Regex Check (.brxs) and Higlight Regex (.hrxs) have been merged into just .brxs (The two entry windows still exist one in the Bible Editor screen and the other in Bible Editor Build screen. They should both be synced up.
	-----7
	------- _xref tags for Bible Editor such as <bk_bname_xref:Gen> should now be {bk_bname_xref:Gen} this better supports the Bible checker. Also <chp_xref:whole> should now be {chp_xref:whole} < > is still possible for backward compatibility. But it is recommended to adjust these to { } 
	-----8
	------- bk_bname_xref needed correction on the regex
	------- Better error checking added for when bk_bname and bk_bi are out of nomral 1-66 range. This generates an error file with the extention BKERRORS plus the map file if enabled is ignored to prevent out of range errors.
	------- References names was not getting the last Reference like 66-REV now fixed
	------9
	------- {bk_xref:current} this is the present book
	------- {chp_xref:current} this is the present chapter
	------- {ver_xref:current} this is the present verse 
	------- These were added to provide more support for <RX so like <RX {bk_xref:current}.1.3> note these tags can be used elsewhere in a Bible they just convert the current information to a book, chapter, or verse number.
	------- They do require <bk_bi:... <bk_bname:... for the {bk_xref:current}; <chp_bi:...> for {chp:xref:current}; <ver:bi:...> for {ver_xref:current}
